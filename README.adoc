A RP2040 controller for the https://github.com/nevermore3d[Nevermore] family of 3D printer filters (including https://github.com/nevermore3d/StealthMax[StealthMax (S)], https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Max[Max], and https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Mini[Mini] variants).
This controller is BlueTooth LE enabled (on Pico W boards), minimising required wiring and allowing multiple clients to interact with the controller. Serial over USB is also supported.

*Refer to the BOM from whatever filter you're building. This is just a basic guide for what kind of hardware is needed.*

NOTE: Sensors are available in various sizes, form factors, and pin orders. Check the filter's BOM to see which you should obtain.

NOTE: xref:supported-sensors[Many sensor boards are multi-function.] e.g. you'll likely only need one board for temperature/humidity.

The only hard requirement is a Pico W.
Everything else can be omitted at the cost of reduced functionality.

The VOC sensors are critical; they measure the relevant contaminants we wish to filter out.

The temperature & humidity sensors are optional; they serve to improve the accuracy of the VOC sensor. If they're omitted, the system will assume some sensible defaults instead.

NOTE: In the future, you'll be able to use Klipper sensors/thermistors to provide these values. This isn't as precise as dedicated sensors, but it's better than nothing. e.g. You could use the temperature from the toolhead's MCU for the intake temperature.

[#guide-setup]
== Setup Guide For Dummies

NOTE: Make sure you meet the xref:klipper-requirements[Klipper requirements].

Instructions:

. Build or https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller/releases[download the controller `uf2` binary], flash to Pico W.
+
The Pico W's LED should start flashing once the controller has booted.

. SSH into the printer. Execute the following to install the Klipper module:
+
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller
cd nevermore-controller
./install-klipper-module.bash
```

. If you're using Mainsail OS then the install script will ask if you wish to enable BlueTooth.
Do so, and then restart the Klipper host. (e.g. `sudo reboot`)

. Add nevermore to the printer config. xref:klipper-config-minimal[Here's a trivial configuration example you can use.]
+
xref:klipper-config-full[See here for complete documentation.]

. Verify Klipper managed to connect to the controller(s) by checking the printer's logs:
+
The log should contain lines similar to:
+
```log
Starting Klippy...
... BLAH
... BLAH
===== Config file =====
... BLAH
... BLAH
=======================
Extruder max_extrude_ratio=... BLAH
mcu 'mcu': Starting CAN connect
... BLAH
... BLAH
# lines saying discovered controller & connected
[11:27:13:976834] nevermore - discovered controller 28:CD:C1:09:64:8F
[11:27:13:981190] nevermore - connected to controller 28:CD:C1:09:64:8F
... BLAH
... BLAH
```
. If you've flashed a OTA-capable UF2 to the controller (v0.3+) you can update it wirelessly.

. **Calibrate the sensors.** xref:doc/voc.adoc#baseline-calibration[See the calibration section in the VOC Guide.]


Configured Nevermores will automatically turn on/off depending on whether any extruder heaters are active. They will also turn on/off depending on sensor values and configured fan policies.


[#guide-updating]
== Updating Guide For Dummies

If you've flashed a OTA-capable UF2 to the controller (v0.3+) you can update it wirelessly. The process is simple:
```sh
# switch to the nevermore-controller installation
cd ~/nevermore-controller
# fetch updates for klipper module and tools
git pull
# download & apply latest controller image
./tools/update_ota.py
```

The when you run `update_ota.py` it will install any missing dependencies.
This can take a while the first time, depending on the machine's capabilities.

If you have multiple controllers in range, you can specify which to update using `--bt-address`. e.g. `./tools/update_ota.py --bt-address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`.

If you're using serial, use `--serial <same path specified in the klipper cfg>` instead of `--bt-address`.

See `./tools/update_ota.py --help` for all options.

NOTE: The controller will automatically restart if left idle in bootloader mode for 60 seconds.

Overall, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Tool environment seems up to date.

=== Uploading Specific Versions & Custom Builds

You may specify `--tag <release-tag>` to upload a specific release instead of the latest.
e.g. `./tools/update_ota.py --tag v0.15.1` to download v0.15.1.

You can also upload custom builds using `--file`. These builds must include a PicoWOTA bootloader; by convention these UF2 files are prefixed with `picowota_ota-`.

If Sanaa sends you a custom build via Discord you can usually apply it as follows:

. Right click on download -> "Copy link"
. Open a SSH shell and run:
```bash
cd ~/nevermore-controller
wget -O picowota_ota-custom.uf2 "<paste link, make sure it is quoted>"
./tools/update_ota.py <serial or bt-address> --file "./picowota_ota-custom.uf2"
```

WARNING: Custom builds are often unstable and can break the bootloader. If something goes wrong you may have to flash an official release using USB & the boot button.


[#usb-console-minicom]
== Getting Console Logs Via USB / UART

If you run into any problems that look hardware related, you can plug the controller via USB or use UART (pins 0, 1) to get logs.
In rare cases USB output might not work, but UART always should. If you have a debug build, this will also work in bootloader mode.

WARNING: When using UART, always connect a shared ground pin between the UART adapter and the Pico _before_ connecting the UART pins. Failure to have a shared 0v can result in hardware damage.

The following assume you're on Linux (you can use the printer's Klipper host) and using USB. Using UART should be identical, just use the UART adapter's serial device instead of the Nevermore directly.

. **If you're using UART instead of USB then connect a shared ground pin before doing anything else.**
See the big note/warning above that you ignored.

. Plug in the controller using a USB cable.
+
The controller should now be visible as a serial device at `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Nevermore_Filter_<board>_<device-id>_if00`.

NOTE: You want the first interface (ends with `_if00`), *not* the second (ends with `_if02`).

. Open a terminal and run `minicom -c on -b 115200 -O timestamp=extended -D /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Nevermore_Filter_<board>_<device-id>_if00`.
+
You will probably get a screen that looks like this:
+
```

```

NOTE: Want to save this log to a file? (e.g. You're debugging a periodic crash.) Add `-C controller.log` to the command line arguments to save a copy of the log in `controller.log`.

NOTE: Need a long term log? Use `tmux` (or equiv) to keep `minicom` alive even if SSH disconnects.

. Restart the controller using one of the following:
.. Use the reset button (if the board has one).
.. Reboot it via `<<NEVERMORE_REBOOT>>` or directly via BLE.
.. Unplug the controller and plug it back in (assuming it is powered by USB only).

. The `minicom` session should now look like this:

```

I2C errors during startup are generally normal and expected; that's how the system probes for sensors. If you see `!! No sensors found?`, however, you probably have a problem (unless there are no sensors connected).

When a sensor is found, there will be a line saying so (e.g. `Found SGP30`, or `Found BME280`).

[#faq]
== FAQ / Known Issues

* **The controller's LED is blinking very quickly and I can't connect to it.**
+
The controller is in bootloader mode. If the image isn't corrupted it'll restart in application mode in about 60 seconds if you leave it alone. If it is corrupted, it won't reboot and will stay in bootloader mode to let you upload a valid image using the update tool.

[#faq-is-the-bluetooth-on]
* **The controller is properly flashed (e.g. the LED is blinking) but my Klipper can't connect to it.**
+
There are several possible causes:
+
. Verify sure the Bluetooth is turned on & working.
If you're using Linux, follow the you can use the following to check
+
```
⋊> ~ # ensure BT is on
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl power on
Changing power on succeeded
⋊> ~ # scan to see if we see any BT devices
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX <censored>
[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX <censored>
^C⏎
```
+
If `bluetoothctl` doesn't work or the scan doesn't list any Bluetooth devices then there's something wrong with the OS's configuration and/or Bluetooth adapter.
You'll need to fix that first (see other FAQ entries for some ideas).
+
. Verify that the Bluetooth adapter can connect to the device. xref:xref:find-the-bt-address-bluetoothctl[If you're on Linux, follow this procedure to find and connect directly to the controller.]
. Verify that *both* the Klipper installation and the controller are the same release version.
+
xref:guide-updating[Easiest way ensure this is to follow the update guide.]
+
If the printer log has exceptions similar to:
+
```
Exception: 4553d138-1d00-4b6f-bc42-955a89cf8c36 (Handle: 67): Unknown doesn't have exactly N characteristic(s) 00002b04-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb with properties ...
```
+
Then you probably have a mismatch between the controller and Klipper module.

+
If you've checked all of the above and you still have exceptions in the printer log then you may go find me on the Nevermore Discord for help.

[#faq-2.4ghz-interference]
* **I'm having trouble getting a reliable connection to the controller. Sometimes it works, sometimes it just doesn't connect.**
+
(This is specifically for the case where the printer log does *not* show any exceptions mentioning bluetooth characteristics; xref:bluez-bad-cache[otherwise see below].)
+
There might be interference on the 2.4 GHz wireless band. Verify the following:
+
** If the Klipper host is connected via WiFi make sure it's using 5.0 GHz, or use Ethernet instead.
+
** If the Klipper host is a Raspberry Pi, make sure the Pi's USB C port is not used. It is not properly shielded and emits EMI.
+
You can test to see if the problem is specific to the Klipper host by xref:find-the-bt-address-nrf-connect[connecting with another machine, such as a pocket supercomputer].


[#bluez-bad-cache]
* **The printer log or nevermore tools show exceptions/errors mentioning missing or unknown 'characteristics' and it can't connect to the controller.**
+
If you encounter an exception or error talking about 'characteristics', such as:
+
```
Exception: <UUID> (Handle: <number>): Unknown has no characteristic <UUID> with properties ...
```
+
Try the following, in order:
+
. xref:guide-updating[Update the controller using OTA.] The controller might be too old for the Klipper module you're using. If you know it's up to date, or can't connect via OTA, continue to 2.
+
. Disable and remove BlueZ GATT caches.
+
BlueZ (Linux's Bluetooth subsystem) has a known bug where it can store corrupt BLE attribute caches. footnote:[Observed in versions up to 5.66.] You can disable and clear this cache to work around this bug:
+
.. ** Disable Caching**
+
Run `sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf` and in the `[GATT]` section change `#Cache = always` to `Cache = no`. If `main.conf` doesn't have a `[GATT]` section, add it and `Cache = no`. e.g.
+
```ini
[GATT]
Cache = no
```
+
Reboot the machine to apply the change.
.. **Remove Existing Caches**
+
Run `sudo bluetoothctl power off`.
+
Get the addresses of all controllers with `sudo ls /var/lib/bluetooth`. They will be of the form `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`.
+
Run for each controller `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/<controller-address>/cache`. (Not all controllers will necessarily have a cache.)
+
Reboot the machine to ensure the BlueZ doesn't persist any cache in memory.

[#faq-mainsail-os]
* **I'm using MainsailOS and I'm having trouble with BlueTooth.**
+
This distro disables BlueTooth by default. footnote:[Mainsail OS disabled BlueTooth to enable hardware UART on Raspberry Pi SBCs.] Please follow https://docs-os.mainsail.xyz/faq/enable-bluetooth-on-rpi[this guide] to enable BlueTooth. Alternatively, the install script will attempt to apply the changes for you.
+
Alternatively, you can flash Klipper to the Pico and use it like any other Klipper MCU.
+
NOTE: I intend to improve the experience for people using a wired connection instead of wireless (via the Klipper MCU), but have no concrete timeline.

* **I'm using the xref:klipper-config-minimal[minimal configuration] and I only see the VOC plot entry in Mainsail/Fluidd, there's no 'Nevermore' item.**
+
Mainsail must be version >= 2.7.1.
Fluidd must be version >= 1.31.0.
If that's fine then double check there isn't any config errors.

[#pin-config-update-bug]
* **Only the intake/exhaust side shows values in Mainsail/Fluidd, the other side only shows `---`.**
+
. Run `./tools/pin-config.py --reset-default`.
+
This fixes a known bug when updating to 0.14+ from older versions that would corrupt the pin config for I2C0 (intake). If this does fix the problem and it was on the exhaust side, then the intake/exhaust I2C lines are swapped.
. Double check the wiring.
+
You can quickly test this by swapping the working side's sensors with the problematic one.
If problematic side starts working then the issue is with the sensors you pulled, otherwise the wiring is the problem.


== Display Support

There are a handful of UIs available. You can select them using the xref:klipper-config-full[`display_ui` Klipper option].

.Supported Display UIs
image::doc/README-display-UIs.png[Supported Display UI,512]

=== Touch Support
Touch display support is early in development and currently very limited.
For now you can:

* Long press on the center area to toggle the fan override on/off
* Press/drag on the fan power ring to set the fan override to a specific percent

== Software Build Requirements

* Pico-W SDK 1.5.1+
* CMake 3.20+
* C++23 compiler, e.g. GCC 12+ (tested w/ 12.2.1)

== Controller Customisation

`src/config.hpp` contains all user-customisable options.
These options are, for the most part, validated at compile time to prevent mistakes.


=== Pin Assignments

Pins assignments can be customised, but are subject to hardware-related constraints. These are constraints are extensively checked at compile time and runtime, and will result in a (hopefully) useful error message if violated. If it compiles, it's a valid configuration.


==== Custom Assignments

The recommended way to customise pin assignments is to use the `pin-config.py` tool:
```sh
# update the pin configuration. follow the on-screen instructions.
~/nevermore-controller/tools/pin-config.py
```

Changes will only take effect after a reboot of the controller.

You can reset the configuration to the board defaults using `--reset-default`.
See `--help` for more options.


==== Default Assignments

WARNING: GPIO 0 and 1 are currently hardcoded for UART. They cannot be used in any pin assignments.

WARNING: The default assignments are tentative and will probably change after we get some feedback as to which layouts work best in practice.

[#persistence]
== Persistent Settings

The controller will save most settings and calibrations to built-in flash
periodically.
To minimise wear & tear, settings are written every 10 minutes (if they've changed),
and sensor calibrations are checkpointed every 24h.
Settings are also immediately written (if changed) before any reboot requests.

The current implementation doesn't distinguish between user customised values
and default ones. Consequently, if default settings change they won't be updated
automatically unless the settings are reset.
This can be done using xref:NEVERMORE_RESET[`NEVERMORE_RESET`], if you are connected via Klipper.


[#klipper]
== Klipper

[#klipper-requirements]
=== Requirements

* xref:faq-is-the-bluetooth-on[Working BlueTooth on the Klipper host.]
* Klipper using Python 3.7+
* KIAUH-like installation (required by installation script)

TL;DR: If you installed everything using https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh[KIAUH], you should be good to go so long as you installed Klipper with Python 3.

=== Configuration

Configuration is typically done using a Klipper instance (e.g. the one on the printer) connected to the controller. Changes to settings are then persisted to flash after ~10 seconds.

NOTE: If you have a non-Klipper printer then you can use a temporary Klipper instance to configure the controller, disconnect it from Klipper, and use it in the non-Klipper printer.

[#klipper-config-minimal]
==== Minimal Example

This example configuration is intended for quickly getting up and running. You can just copy paste this into the printer's config.

Check out the full documentation section (just after this) after you've tested everything works with the minimal configuration; there are many useful options for customisation.

[#klipper-object-naming]
=== Klipper Object Naming

Nevermore instances have two kinds of names:
* Short names: Used by GCode commands (i.e. `NEVERMORE=<short name>`).
* Full Klipper names: Used by the Klipper config files.

NOTE: Full Klipper full names are case and whitespace sensitive.

.Nevermore Object Names
[%autowidth]
|===
|Klipper Config Declaration | Short Name    | Full Klipper Name   | LED Effect Name
|`[nevermore]`              | `nevermore`   | `nevermore`         | `nevermore`
|`[nevermore Foo_Bar]`      | `Foo_Bar`     | `nevermore Foo_Bar` | `nevermore:Foo_Bar`
|===

When referring to a Nevermore for LED effects, use the full Klipper name and replace any spaces with `:`.


[#klipper-gcode-commands]
=== G-Code Commands

The following command can be used to influence behaviour at runtime.

These typically require a `NEVERMORE=` parameter to specify which Nevermore to interact with.
At this time, there can only be one Nevermore controller, which is named `nevermore`.


==== NEVERMORE_VENT_SERVO_SET

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_VENT_SERVO_SET [NEVERMORE=<name>] [PERCENT=<float \in [0, 1]>] [HOLD_FOR=<seconds > 0, optional>]
```

Set the vent's servo pulse to the specified % between . Omitting `PERCENT` disables the servo.
Specifying `HOLD_FOR` disables the servo after the specified # of seconds.
`HOLD_FOR` requires a `PERCENT`.


==== NEVERMORE_STATUS

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_STATUS [NEVERMORE=<name>]
```

Prints the Nevermores' current status to the console.
Lists all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.
Not terribly useful for most things, but helpful if you're not sure it's connected
yet. (e.g. when used with `connection_initial_timeout: 0`)

==== NEVERMORE_REBOOT

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_REBOOT [NEVERMORE=<name>]
```

Reboots Nevermores, if connected. Persistent settings will be saved.
Applies to all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.

Probably easier than power cycling the whole printer.


==== NEVERMORE_RESET

WARNING: *This command should not be used unless directed by Someone Who Knows What They're Doing.*

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_RESET FLAGS=<int> [NEVERMORE=<name>]
```

Resets persistent settings to defaults.
It is deliberately under-documented to dissuade causal use.
Applies to all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.

Policy settings can can be reset to default using `FLAGS=2`.


==== NEVERMORE_VOC_CALIBRATION

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_VOC_CALIBRATION ENABLED={0, 1} [NEVERMORE=<name>]
```

WARNING: Calibration is automatically suspended by the Klipper module when any extruders have a target temperature. It is resumed when no extruders have a target temperature. You should not have to explicitly use this command in typical scenarios.

Enables/disables the VOC sensor calibration.
*Sensor calibration should be enabled whenever the printer isn't printing.*
Applies to all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.

Sensor calibration should *only* be disabled when the printer is printing. Doing
this prevents the VOC sensor from mistaking low VOC emissions for sensor drift
and implicitly compensating for it.

This should be used in conjunction with `NEVERMORE_VOC_GATING_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDE`
to automatically enable/disable VOC calibration if the air is still dirty post-print.

VOC sensor calibration is always enabled when the controller powers on.


==== NEVERMORE_VOC_GATING_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDE

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_VOC_GATING_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDE [NEVERMORE=<name>] [THRESHOLD=<int \in [175, 500]>]
```

Overrides the VOC gating threshold (see `voc_gating_threshold` in the Klipper config). Omit the `THRESHOLD` parameter to clear any existing override.
Applies to all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.

This is intended for setups where the slicer specifies the filament type using a user-defined G-Code macro (e.g. `SET_MATERIAL ABS`), and you would like to temporarily set the VOC gating threshold for a specific material/filament.

Unlike the `voc_gating_threshold`, this is setting is *not* persisted and will be lost when the controller restarts.


==== NEVERMORE_SENSOR_CALIBRATION_CHECKPOINT

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_SENSOR_CALIBRATION_CHECKPOINT [NEVERMORE=<name>]
```

Force sensors to checkpoint their calibration.
The checkpoints will be persisted after a brief delay (under 20 seconds).
Applies to all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.

Useful if you must save the current calibration immediately instead of waiting
for the usual 24h periodic checkpoint.
e.g. xref:doc/voc.adoc#baseline-calibration[After a short baseline calibration.]


==== NEVERMORE_SENSOR_CALIBRATION_RESET

Command:
```
NEVERMORE_SENSOR_CALIBRATION_RESET [NEVERMORE=<name>]
```

Resets the sensor calibrations. Does not immediately persist this reset calibration, but it will eventually be applied when the checkpoint process triggers.
Applies to all Nevermores unless a specific one is named using`NEVERMORE=`.

Useful when moving the printer to a new environment.


=== Finding The BT Address

**If you have only one Nevermore controller in range then you can omit the `bt_address` option in the printer configuration and ignore this section entirely.**

If you have multiple BlueTooth (BT) devices in range that look like candidates for a Nevermore controller, then you have to specify which one to use. This is done by specifying their 'address' in the printer config using `bt_address: <address>`.

On Linux and Windows hosts, this address looks like `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`, where `X` is a hexadecimal digit.

On MacOS hosts, this address is a randomly assigned UUID specific to that host.

NOTE: It is possible, but very rare, for the address to change when a new `uf2` is flashed onto the Pico. This has been observed once after updating the Pico SDK.

==== Method A - Check the Klipper Log

An error will be raised if there are multiple controllers in range.
The error message will list all the available controllers' addresses.

Pick one from the list and stuff that into the `nevermore` section's `bt_address`.

For example, given this log:

```log
...
...
[11:06:36:535560] nevermore - multiple nevermore controllers discovered.
specify which to use by setting `bt_address: <insert-address-here>` in the Klipper config.
discovered controllers (ordered by signal strength):
    address           | signal strength
    -----------------------------------
    FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01 | -38 dBm
    FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 | -57 dBm
Config error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/klipper/klippy/klippy.py", line 180, in _connect
    cb()
  File "~/klipper/klippy/extras/nevermore.py", line 793, in _handle_connect
    raise self.printer.config_error("nevermore failed to connect - timed out")
configparser.Error: nevermore failed to connect - timed out
...
...
```

We could use `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01` or `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00`.

In this case I'd plug in `FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01` since that device has the strongest signal, i.e. closest-ish to the Klipper host.

[#find-the-bt-address-bluetoothctl]
==== Method B - Linux Only - `bluetoothctl`

NOTE: Only works on Linux. Yes, I know you didn't read the title.

. Make sure the Nevermore controller is powered and the LED is blinking. (Indicates it is active.)

. In a terminal, run: `bluetoothctl`
+
This'll open a REPL interface.
+
```
⋊> ~ bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[CHG] Controller FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-FF Pairable: yes
[bluetooth]#
```

. Run: `scan on`, **wait a few seconds** (~5 or 6 is plenty)
+
Starts background scan for devices.
This isn't a blocking command, you can issue other commands as it scans in the background.
+
```
[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-FF Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 <censored>
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 Nevermore
[CHG] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 RSSI: -53
[CHG] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 ManufacturerData Key: 0x004c
...
[DEL] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
[NEW] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
...
```
+
WARNING: If you wait too long (~15-20 seconds), the scan ends, and the host will forget about the devices it discovered.

. Run: `devices`
+
```
[bluetooth]# devices
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:05 <censored>
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01 Nevermore
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:04 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-04
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 Nevermore
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:02 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-02
Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:03 FA-KE-AD-RE-SS-03
```
+
Look for the entries named "Nevermore", "Nevermore Controller", or "picowota" footnote:[This is the name it uses when in bootloader mode. Unfortunately BlueZ is too aggressive about caching device names.], and copy their address into the printer configuration.
+
In this example, we could use `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00` or `bt_address: FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:01`.

. You should try connecting to the controller to verify that there's no significant interference:
+
Run: `connect <BT address>`
+
```
[bluetooth]# connect FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00
Attempting to connect to FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00
[CHG] Device FA:KE:AD:RE:SS:00 Connected: yes
Connection successful
<lots of of new services/characteristics announced>
```
+
If connecting fails, or momentarily succeeds and then connection is lost, then there might be interference from the WiFi adapter. xref:faq-2.4ghz-interference[See this FAQ for details.]


[#find-the-bt-address-nrf-connect]
==== Method C - Use A Phone + nRF Connect

WARNING: If you're hosting Klipper on MacOS then you cannot use this approach and must use <<Method A - Check the Klipper Log>>.

nRF Connect is an app by Nordic Semi.
It's meant for debugging/exploring BLE devices, but we can (ab)use to find the BT addresses.

Load the app, scan for BLE devices. The controllers will all be named "Nevermore" (or "picowota", if in bootloader more), and their BT addresses will be listed below.

.nRF Connect displays device names & addresses
image::doc/README-nrf-connect.png[nRC Connect Screenshot,256]

You can test if the controller is accepting new connections by pressing the 'connect' button.


[#fan-control]
=== Fan Control & Macros

There are two modes of operation:

* Automatic - Fan power is managed by the controller based on its fan policy (xref:klipper-config-full[see here]).

* Manual - Fan power is overridden and will run at the specified power until the override is cleared.

In both cases, the fan power is scaled by two factors:

* The `fan_power_coefficient` setting scales in all cases. Useful for limiting noise since the StealthMax recommended fans are more powerful than strictly needed.

* Thermal Limiting scales the actual fan power applied based on the maximum of the intake and exhaust temperatures. This is intended to improve the carbon's effective lifespan, which degrades at high temperatures. This feature can be disabled by setting xref:klipper-config-full[`fan_thermal_limit_coefficient: 1`].


From within Klipper, the fan can be controlled much like any other fan:

```gcode
; override automatic fan control, full speed ahead
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1
; not specifying `SPEED=` disables fan override and returns to automatic fan control
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan
```

WARNING: Setting the fan speed to 0 in Mainsail/Fluidd UI does **not** clear the control override. It just sets it to zero. (i.e. disables the fan)

If you would like to limit the maximum speed of the fan, e.g. to reduce noise, xref:klipper-config-full[set `fan_power_coefficient` to a value < 1].

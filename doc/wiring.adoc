A guide for building attractive wire nests that'll impress anyone, guaranteed.

These guides should *not* be considered authoritative: if ever in doubt, refer to the BOM/build guide for your filter and the pins list in the main documentation.

NOTE: The diagrams themselves were not made by Sanaa, and credit should be attributed to their authors listed above each section.

== Gotchas & General Notes (READ ME DAMN IT)

* **Build and test all your electronics twice: once before mounting anything in a build, then again once everything is mounted but just before you screw/press everything closed.**
footnote:[This really matters for builds like the StealthMax, where there's 20,00+ screws and half the parts of press-fit and are not made to be easily disassembled.]
+
Complete the entire xref:testing-checklist[Electronics Testing Checklist].
+
The electronics system should be fully operational on your table/floor/work surface before anything else gets built.
This will save you from disassembling the entire build if something was damaged during soldering, wiring, or assembly.



* **You might not need everything you see.**
+
These guides often include optional components.

* **Some features/hardware might not be shown.**
+
These guides are not necessarily complete/exhaustive.

* **Wagos are shown for clarity but you might have to splice/solder wires instead.**
+
Consider them optional, depending on your budget and filter. (e.g. Wagos might not fit in the space available.) You just need to ensure those wires are on the same circuit.

* **Use 3.3v to power your sensors instead of 5v when possible.**
** All footnote:[Almost all?] sensor boards can handle 3.3v. This is not true for 5v.
** If you screw up your wiring (e.g. swap V~in~ with SCL or SDA), you're less likely to fry your device. Avoid doing that.

* **Voltage converters can usually be avoided.**
+
Most aftermarket printer boards can serve as an external PSU providing both 12v and 5v: 12v, 0v from an always-on fan port, and 5v from any Pi power, probe pin, etc.
+
NOTE: If you're using a lot of 12v equipment (e.g. hotend and bed), double check that you're not overloading the 12v rail. This is quite unlikely, but best be safe.

* **Power the Pico/RP2040 using `VSYS`, not `VBUS`.**
+
Powering using the `VBUS` pin will cause the controller to think it is connected via USB, and will cause it to wait while for a serial port connection during startup. This isn't a fatal mistake but it is trivial to avoid.


[#testing-checklist]
=== Electronics Testing Checklist

If any of these fail, fix them before proceeding with the rest of the build.

[%interactive]
* [ ] Fan Works: Fan spins when powered **and PWM pin is disconnected**.
* [ ] Controller Flashed: Controller's LED blinks slowly (~1 hz)
* [ ] Klipper Connects: The `NEVERMORE_STATUS` G-Code command should report "connected". xref:../README.adoc[See main documentation.]
* [ ] Sensors Registering: Mainsail shows *sane* values for intake and exhaust temperature, humidity, and VOC index. (It can take up to 30 seconds after power on for VOC to show up.)
* [ ] Fan PWM: Can turn on/off the fan using `SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=0/1`.
* [ ] Fan Tachometer: Fan RPM in Mainsail is non-zero when fan is turned on.


== Standard Fan Pin Layout

> Help! All the fan wires are black/white/fuchsia! How do I tell them apart?

Assuming the fan's mfg isn't insane:

.Standard 4 Pin Fan Connector Layout

For 3 pins, it's exactly the same except you don't have a PWM pin.

If you've any doubts, test by briefly pulsing what you think is V~in~ and ground with 5v. If the fan twitches, you got the right ones and can deduce the rest of the pins.

=== General / Nevermore StealthMax (S) - Pico W

**Author: Fragmon (Steven, Crydteam)**

This diagram is illustrates a Pico W setup w/ nearly all features enabled. This would typically be seen in a https://github.com/nevermore3d/StealthMax[Nevermore StealthMax (S)] filter, though the display is not a standard feature and would require either a custom cap (search the Discord) or be mounted outside the filter.

=== https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Mini[Nevermore Mini] - https://www.waveshare.com/product/rp2040-touch-lcd-1.28.htm[Waveshare Touch 1.28"]

**Author: Fragmon (Steven, Crydteam)**

This diagram is intended for a setup where the filter is powered by a USB port in the base of the filter.

NOTE: The fan listed in the diagram is rated for 12v but can operate at 5v.

WARNING: The general release UF2 **cannot** be used with this board because it is not a Pico W. There are custom builds floating on the discord. Consider this a beta/early release.
